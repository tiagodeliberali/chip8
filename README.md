# Chip8 Rust emulator
Chip8 implementation, based on [Chapter 5](https://livebook.manning.com/book/rust-in-action/chapter-5/) of the book Rust In Action.

Reference documentation for implementing operations from Matthew Mikolay, [Mastering CHIP-8](http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html).

Also, lots of debuging comparing with the Colin Eberhardt's [Chip8 emulator](https://colineberhardt.github.io/wasm-rust-chip8/web/).

## work in progress
 - Operations from opcode 8 not implemented
 - Operations from opcode F not implementedx'
 - Missing tests for most of operations
